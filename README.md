# Raspberry Pi Pico tutorials

This repository holds all the source code and other resources used in my tutorial series on **[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/SladorSoft)**.

VS Code assumes that you have set these environment variables:
- **PICO_SDK_PATH** - points to the Raspberry Pi Pico SDK
- **GNUARM_DIR** - points to the ARM GNU Toolchain

You can find the source code used in each video in the **src** directory and a schematic of each contraption in **schematics**.
They have been created with [KiCad](https://www.kicad.org/). Please note, that I have been using **version 7**, so the schematics may not be down-compatible with the older versions of KiCad.
There are also PDF versions of each of the schematics included.
